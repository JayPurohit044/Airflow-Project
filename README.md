### Project Overview: Podcast Transcription Pipeline

This project involves creating a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate the process of downloading podcast episodes, transcribing them using speech recognition, and storing the transcriptions in an SQLite database. The pipeline ensures efficient handling of audio data and provides a scalable solution for managing and querying podcast transcriptions.

### Project Steps

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Install and configure Apache Airflow.
   - Set up the necessary dependencies for speech recognition and SQLite.

2. **Podcast Episode Download**
   - Create an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to schedule and manage the download of podcast episodes.
   - Use Python scripts to download episodes from specified podcast RSS feeds.

3. **Speech Recognition**
   - Integrate a speech recognition library (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, SpeechRecognition) to transcribe the downloaded audio files.
   - Develop a task in the Airflow DAG to process each audio file and generate transcriptions.

4. **Data Storage**
   - Set up an SQLite database to store the transcriptions.
   - Create tables and schema to organize the transcriptions and associated metadata (e.g., episode title, date).

5. **Pipeline Orchestration**
   - Define dependencies and task sequences in the Airflow DAG to ensure smooth execution of the pipeline.
   - Implement error handling and logging to monitor the pipeline's performance and troubleshoot issues.

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test the pipeline with sample podcast episodes to ensure accurate transcription and data storage.
   - Validate the transcriptions by comparing them with the original audio content.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - Deploy the Airflow pipeline on a production server or cloud environment.
   - Set up monitoring and alerting to track the pipeline's health and performance.
